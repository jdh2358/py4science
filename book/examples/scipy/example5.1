 Optimization Tools

A collection of general-purpose optimization routines.

  fmin        --  Nelder-Mead Simplex algorithm
                    (uses only function calls)
  fmin_powell --  Powell's (modified) level set method (uses only 
                    function calls)
  fmin_bfgs   --  Quasi-Newton method (can use function and gradient)
  fmin_ncg    --  Line-search Newton Conjugate Gradient (can use
                    function, gradient and hessian).
  leastsq     --  Minimize the sum of squares of M equations in
                    N unknowns given a starting estimate.

 Scalar function minimizers

  fminbound   --  Bounded minimization of a scalar function.
  brent       --  1-D function minimization using Brent method.
  golden      --  1-D function minimization using Golden Section method
  bracket     --  Bracket a minimum (given two starting points)
 
Also a collection of general_purpose root-finding routines.

  fsolve      --  Non-linear multi-variable equation solver.

 Scalar function solvers

  brentq      --  quadratic interpolation Brent method
  brenth      --  Brent method (modified by Harris with
                    hyperbolic extrapolation)
  ridder      --  Ridder's method
  bisect      --  Bisection method
  newton      --  Secant method or Newton's method

  fixed_point -- Single-variable fixed-point solver.
