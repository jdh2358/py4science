 Practical Scientific Computing in Python - Agenda
===================================================

Initials indicate who presents what:

JDH - John D. Hunter
FP  - Fernando Perez
JW  - Jeff Whitaker


Day 1 (Friday December 7)
=========================

830-900 Installation
This half hour will be spent helping with installation issues, before the
real workshop begins.  If you've already set things up on your system
(meaning you have ipython, numpy, matplotlib and scipy installed and
running), feel free to skip this.

900-905 Introduction 
Official start of the workshop, introduce instructors.

905-945 FP: Python for scientific computing
A high-level overview of the topic of Python in a scientific context.

950-1045 JDH: Workflow.

Editor: (X)Emacs, Vi(m), etc.

ipython.  Saving and reloading files, interactive use of variables, %run,
%debug, %xmode verbose.

Getting help:
  - pydoc (-g, -p)

  - The standard docs (bookmark them)

  - ipython ?/??, help(), the tab key.  numpy.*cos*? search.

  - The open source process: mailing lists, wikis, svn.  Python
  cookbook. Participate!


Basic setup:
  - ipython
  - matplotlib (latex, etc).
  - Modules: import/reload, PYTHONPATH.


1045:1100 --- Coffee break ---


1100:1215 FP: Introductory examples.

* Qsort: lists, recursion.

* Define a simple function: Wallis' product for pi.  Illustrates arbitrary
size integers.

* Define a trapezoid rule integrator: function objects, arrays.

1215:1315 --- Lunch Break ---

1315:1400 JDH: Basic numpy/pylab

* Record arrays

* Timeseries

1400:1430 FP: Numerical integration and root finding: Find t such that

 \int_0^t{ f(s) ds} = u

for a known, monotonically increasing f(s) and a fixed u.


1430:1500 FP: Univariate polynomials, root finding: poly1d objects,
convolutions, plotting.

1500:1515 --- Coffee break ---

1515:1700: JDH/FP - Optional material (there's a Christmas party)

* Word frequencies: use of dictionaries and text processing.

* Getbibtex: fetching bibliographic information from the net (networking,
  regular expressions, command-line scripting).

* Beautiful soup: screen-scraping HTML for data extraction.

* Possible 3d demos (not user exercises) using VPython and VTK/MayaVi.


Day 2 (Saturday December 8)
===========================

900:945 JDH: Data fitting/smoothing: least squares, cubic splines, polynomial
fitting.  Basic linear algebra.

945:1030 FP: FFTs: 2-d image denoising via FFT.

1030:1045 --- Coffee break ---

1045:1130 JDH: Logistic map

1130:1200 FP: Bessel functions: special functions library, array manipulations
to check recursion relation.

1200:1300 --- Lunch break ---

1300:1345 JDH: Statistics & distributions

1345:1445 FP:

* Montecarlo integration to compute pi.

* Speed: weave.blitz, weave.inline.

1445:1500 Wrapup, discussion, questions, coffee.



Unused examples and exercises, extra ideas
==========================================

* Prime numbers: the Sieve of Erathostenes.  Illustrates lists and sets.

* Visual (VPython): Show some examples, explain.  Target shooting exercise.

* Eigenfaces problem, part 1.

* Eigenfaces problem, part 2.

* One-dimensional FFT - Bode plot.

* Spectral interpolation.

* Steinman interpolation.

* Extended precision root finding: manually implement newton's method using
  clnum or mpfr.
