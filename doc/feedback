Hi,

while we put a lot of effort in trying to ensure that the python for
scientific computing workshop was useful, it is always possible to do things
better.  We would be very grateful if you could take a few minutes to answer
the few simple questions below as honestly as you can.  It will help us
improve things if there is a chance to hold a similar exercise in the future.

By default, your replies will be forwarded to Fernando anonymously.  If you
wish to have your name be left in your response, please indicate so.  Feel
free to fill out this form simply by replying in between questions.


Feedback for the Python for scientific computing workshop
=========================================================

0. Note here if you wish your name to be included in the final summary.
Otherwise your reply will be anonymous.


1. Overall format: did you find the overall format of the workshop useful?

As a reminder, the format was: an introductory overview talk, a setup/workflow
discussion, and then only participant-driven exercises with solutions given
and discussed at the end of each exercise.

Is there anything you'd like to see changed regarding this aspect?


2. Exercises:

  a. Difficulty: was the level of difficulty of the exercises appropriate, too
  low, too high?  Were the hints given both in the skeletons and interactively
  either too much or not enough?

  b. Coverage - concepts: Did you feel the exercises were varied and decoupled
  enough so that each would teach something useful without undue repetition?
  Is there any basic concept you think was not properly covered?

  c. Coverage - topics: Is there any particular topic that you feel should
  have been covered?  If so, what area from the current material would you
  remove to include the new topic (assuming that a third day is not available,
  so that any new topic requires removing something)?

  d. Pace: how did you find the pace of the work?  Was too much time being
  given for each exercise, or not enough?


3. General comments:

  a. What aspects of the workshop did you particularly like or find useful?

  b. Which ones did you not like or find not useful?

  c. Any other comments on things we can improve or do differently for the
  future.


4. Quotable material: Any general positive comments you may wish to make,
which we can quote (anonymously if so desired) for future workshops?
