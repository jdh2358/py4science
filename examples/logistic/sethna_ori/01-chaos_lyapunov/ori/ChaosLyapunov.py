    Calculates the difference between two trajectories that start

    Returns list of length N+1,
    [x2-x1, g(x2)-g(x1), g(g(x2))-g(g(x1)), ...]

    Used for illustrating sensitive dependence on initial conditions for
    chaotic regions, and for calculating Lyapunov exponents.

    You can usefully pick x2-x1 comparable to machine precision (seventeen
    digits). Don't choose x1 or x2 to equal zero or one in the logistic 
    map: zero is an unstable fixed point.

    The residual is the difference between the data and the fit:
    if the residuals were zero, the trajectory difference would be 
    perfectly described as a growing exponential.
    That is, the growth of the difference between two trajectories is 
    expected to be of the form
        |x_n - y_n| \sim lyapPrefactor * exp(lyapExponent n)

    We take the log of the difference so that the least--squares fit
    will emphasize the initial points and final points roughly equally.
    We use the log of the lyapPrefactor because it must be positive:
    it's a standard trick in nonlinear fitting to change variables like
    this to enforce ranges in parameters.

    Used by FitLyapunovExponent to generate a least-squares fit for 
    the Lyapunov exponent and prefactor.
