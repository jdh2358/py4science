Customizing the site
*********************

the `<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ site itself looks better than the
sites created with the default css, so here we'll invoke Tufte's
phrase "Intelligence imitates but genious steals and grab their css
and part of their layout.  As before, you can either get the required
files :file:`_static/sphinx.css` and :file:`_templates:layout.html`
from the website or svn (see :ref:`fetching-the-data`)
