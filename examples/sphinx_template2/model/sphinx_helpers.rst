******************
Sphinx Cheat Sheet
******************

Wherein I show by example how to do some things in Sphinx (you can see
a literal version of this file below in :ref:`sphinx-literal`)


.. _making-a-list:

Making a list
=============

It is easy to make lists in rest

Bullet points
-------------

This is a subsection making bullet points

* point A

* point B

* point C


Enumerated points
------------------

This is a subsection making numbered points

#. point A

#. point B

#. point C


.. _making-a-table:

Making a table
==============

This shows you how to make a table -- if you only want to make a list see :ref:`making-a-list`.

==================   ============
Name                 Age
==================   ============
John D Hunter        40
Cast of Thousands    41
And Still More       42
==================   ============

.. _making-links:

Making links
============

It is easy to make a link to `yahoo <http://yahoo.com>`_ or to some
section inside this document (see :ref:`making-a-table`) or another
document (see :ref:`final-results`).

You can also reference classes, modules, functions, etc that are
documented using the sphinx `autodoc
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ext/autodoc.html>`_ facilites.  For example,
see the module :mod:`matplotlib.backend_bases` documentation, or the
class :class:`~matplotlib.backend_bases.LocationEvent`, or the method
:meth:`~matplotlib.backend_bases.FigureCanvasBase.mpl_connect`.

.. _ipython-highlighting:

ipython sessions
================

Michael Droettboom contributed a sphinx extension which does pygments
syntax highlighting on ipython sessions

.. sourcecode:: ipython

    In [69]: lines = plot([1,2,3])

    In [70]: setp(lines)
      alpha: float
      animated: [True | False]
      antialiased or aa: [True | False]
      ...snip

This support is included in this template, but will also be included
in a future version of Pygments by default.

.. _formatting-text:

Formatting text
===============

You use inline markup to make text *italics*, **bold**, or ``monotype``.

You can represent code blocks fairly easily::

   import numpy as np
   x = np.random.rand(12)

Or literally include code:

.. literalinclude:: ../pyplots/elegant.py


.. _using-math:

Using math
==========

In sphinx you can include inline math :math:`x\leftarrow y\ x\forall
y\ x-y` or display math

.. math::

  W^{3\beta}_{\delta_1 \rho_1 \sigma_2} = U^{3\beta}_{\delta_1 \rho_1} + \frac{1}{8 \pi 2} \int^{\alpha_2}_{\alpha_2} d \alpha^\prime_2 \left[\frac{ U^{2\beta}_{\delta_1 \rho_1} - \alpha^\prime_2U^{1\beta}_{\rho_1 \sigma_2} }{U^{0\beta}_{\rho_1 \sigma_2}}\right]

This documentation framework includes a Sphinx extension,
:file:`sphinxext/mathmpl.py`, that uses matplotlib to render math
equations when generating HTML, and LaTeX itself when generating a
PDF.  This can be useful on systems that have matplotlib, but not
LaTeX, installed.  To use it, add ``mathmpl`` to the list of
extensions in :file:`conf.py`.

Current SVN versions of Sphinx now include built-in support for math.
There are two flavors:

  - pngmath: uses dvipng to render the equation

  - jsmath: renders the math in the browser using Javascript

To use these extensions instead, add ``sphinx.ext.pngmath`` or
``sphinx.ext.jsmath`` to the list of extensions in :file:`conf.py`.

All three of these options for math are designed to behave in the same
way.

.. _emacs-helpers:

Inserting matplotlib plots
==========================

Inserting automatically-generated plots is easy.  Simply put the
script to generate the plot in the :file:`pyplots` directory, and
refer to it using the ``plot`` directive.  To include the source code
for the plot in the document, pass the ``include-source`` parameter::

  .. plot:: ../pyplots/elegant.py
     :include-source:

In the HTML version of the document, the plot includes links to the
original source code, a high-resolution PNG and a PDF.  In the PDF
version of the document, the plot is included as a scalable PDF.

.. plot:: ../pyplots/elegant.py
   :include-source:

Inheritance diagrams
====================

Inheritance diagrams can be inserted directly into the document by
providing a list of class or module names to the
``inheritance-diagram`` directive.

For example::

  .. inheritance-diagram:: codecs

produces:

.. inheritance-diagram:: codecs

Emacs helpers
=============

There is an emacs mode `rst.el
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/tools/editors/emacs/rst.el>`_ which
automates many important ReST tasks like building and updateing
table-of-contents, and promoting or demoting section headings.  Here
is the basic ``.emacs`` configuration::

    (require 'rst)
    (setq auto-mode-alist
          (append '(("\\.txt$" . rst-mode)
                    ("\\.rst$" . rst-mode)
                    ("\\.rest$" . rst-mode)) auto-mode-alist))


Some helpful functions::

    C-c TAB - rst-toc-insert

      Insert table of contents at point

    C-c C-u - rst-toc-update

        Update the table of contents at point

    C-c C-l rst-shift-region-left

        Shift region to the left

    C-c C-r rst-shift-region-right

        Shift region to the right
