This is the workbook for the py4science course.  It is made up of a
bunch of different units, each of which lives in a separate *.tex
file.  To make a new unit, copy template.tex to yourfile.tex and fill
it in.  We use the latex listing package for including python source
code.

For every unit, create an example in
../problems_solved/your_problem.py, and a skeleton in
../problems_skel/your_problem_skel.py.  If there are any figures, you
should create a PNG and EPS version of each and add them to the fig
subdirectory of the workbook directory.  You will need to svn add your
tex file, problem, skeleton, skeleton symlink, and figures.

You can build the workbook in skeleton form with

  > make skeletons  # create workbook_skeletons.pdf

and in solved form with

  > make solved     # creates workbook_solved.pdf
