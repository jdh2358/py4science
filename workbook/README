This is the workbook for the py4science course.  It is made up of a
bunch of different units, each of which lives in a separate *.tex
file.  To make a new unit, copy template.tex to yourfile.tex and fill
it in.  We use the latex listing package for including python source
code.

For every unit, create an example in ../examples/your_example.py, a
skeleton in ../examples/your_example_skel.py, and a symlink from
../examples/your_example_skel.py -> examples_skel/your_example.py
(../examples is in the top level of the py4science repository).  If
there are any figures, you should create a PNG and EPS version of each
and add them to the fig subdirectory of the workbook directory.  You
will need to svn add your tex file, example, skeleton, skeleton
symlink, and figures.

You can build the workbook in skeleton form with

  > make skeletons  # create workbook_skeletons.pdf

and in solved form with

  > make solved     # creates workbook_solved.pdf
