This is the workbook for the py4science course.  It is made up of a
bunch of different units, each of which lives in a separate *.tex
file.  To make a new unit, copy template.tex to yourfile.tex and fill
it in.  We use the latex listing package for including python source
code.

For every unit with an example in the :file:`examples` create the
solutions an skeletons for the workbook, with for example::

  ./add_problem NAME

See the :file:`add_problem` script in this dir
../problems_solved/your_problem.py.

If there are any figures, you should create a PNG and EPS version of
each and add them to the fig subdirectory of the workbook directory.
You will need to svn add your tex file, problem, skeleton, skeleton
symlink, and figures.

There is a file:`template.tex` which is a template for adding an
example to the workbook.  Copy it to your_example.tex and replace the
template content with your content -- this example shows how to
include figures, excercises, ipython sessions, etc...

You can build the workbook in skeleton form with

  > make skel  # create workbook_skeletons.pdf

and in solved form with

  > make sol     # creates workbook_solved.pdf
