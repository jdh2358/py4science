                 greatly enhances its immediate usability. This library
                 contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide
                 access to system functionality such as file I/O that
                 would otherwise be inaccessible to Python programmers,
                 as well as modules written in Python that provide
                 standardized solutions for many problems that occur in
                 everyday programming. Some of theses modules are
                 explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the

  abstract =     "Python is a small and easy-to-learn language with
                 surprising capabilities. It is an interpreted
                 object-oriented scripting language and has a full range
                 of sophisticated features such as first-class
                 functions, garbage collection, and exception handling.
                 Python has properties that make it especially appealing
                 for scientific programming: Python is quite simple and
                 easy to learn, but it is a full and complete language.
                 It is simple to extend Python with your own compiled
                 objects and functions. Python is portable, from Unix to
                 Windows 95 to Linux to Macintosh. Python is free, with
                 no license required even if you make a commercial
                 product out of it. Python has a large user-contributed
                 library of ``modules''. These modules cover a wide
                 variety of needs, such as audio and image processing,
                 World Wide Web programming, and graphical user
                 interfaces. In particular, there is an interface to the
                 popular Tk package for building windowing applications.
                 And now, Python has a high-performance array module
                 similar to the facilities in specialized array
                 languages such as Matlab, IDL, Basis, or Yorick. This
                 extension also adds complex numbers to the language.
                 Array operations in Python lead to the execution of
                 loops in C, so that most of the work is done at full
                 compiled speed.",

                 computations. Experiences of using an object-oriented
