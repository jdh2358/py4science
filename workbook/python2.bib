  abstract       = {We give an introduction to some of the numerical
                   aspects in quantum chaos. The classical dynamics of
                   two--dimensional area--preserving maps on the torus is
                   illustrated using the standard map and a perturbed cat
                   map. The quantization of area--preserving maps given by
                   their generating function is discussed and for the
                   computation of the eigenvalues a computer program in
                   Python is presented. We illustrate the eigenvalue
                   distribution for two types of perturbed cat maps, one
                   leading to COE and the other to CUE statistics. For the
                   eigenfunctions of quantum maps we study the
                   distribution of the eigenvectors and compare them with
                   the corresponding random matrix distributions. The
                   Husimi representation allows for a direct comparison of
                   the localization of the eigenstates in phase space with
                   the corresponding classical structures. Examples for a
                   perturbed cat map and the standard map with different
                   parameters are shown. Billiard systems and the
                   corresponding quantum billiards are another important
                   class of systems (which are also relevant to
                   applications, for example in mesoscopic physics). We
                   provide a detailed exposition of the boundary integral
                   method, which is one important method to determine the
                   eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Helmholtz
                   equation. We discuss several methods to determine the
                   eigenvalues from the Fredholm equation and illustrate
                   them for the stadium billiard. The occurrence of
                   spurious solutions is discussed in detail and
                   illustrated for the circular billiard, the stadium
                   billiard, and the annular sector billiard. We emphasize
                   the role of the normal derivative function to compute
                   the normalization of eigenfunctions, momentum
                   representations or autocorrelation functions in a very
                   efficient and direct way. Some examples for these
                   quantities are given and discussed. },

  abstract       = "Python is a small and easy-to-learn language with
                   surprising capabilities. It is an interpreted
                   object-oriented scripting language and has a full range
                   of sophisticated features such as first-class
                   functions, garbage collection, and exception handling.
                   Python has properties that make it especially appealing
                   for scientific programming: Python is quite simple and
                   easy to learn, but it is a full and complete language.
                   It is simple to extend Python with your own compiled
                   objects and functions. Python is portable, from Unix to
                   Windows 95 to Linux to Macintosh. Python is free, with
                   no license required even if you make a commercial
                   product out of it. Python has a large user-contributed
                   library of ``modules''. These modules cover a wide
                   variety of needs, such as audio and image processing,
                   World Wide Web programming, and graphical user
                   interfaces. In particular, there is an interface to the
                   popular Tk package for building windowing applications.
                   And now, Python has a high-performance array module
                   similar to the facilities in specialized array
                   languages such as Matlab, IDL, Basis, or Yorick. This
                   extension also adds complex numbers to the language.
                   Array operations in Python lead to the execution of
                   loops in C, so that most of the work is done at full
                   compiled speed.",
