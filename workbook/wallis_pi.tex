\section{Wallis' slow road to $\pi$}

\textbf{Illustrates}: arbitrary size integers, simple function definitions.

Wallis' formula is an infinite product that converges (slowly) to
$\pi$:\begin{equation}
\pi=\prod_{i=1}^{\infty}\frac{4i^{2}}{4i^{2}-1}.\end{equation}


The listing~\ref{code:wallis_pi} contains a skeleton with no
implementation but with some plotting commands already inserted, so
that you can visualize the convergence rate of this formula as more
terms are kept.

After running the script successfully, you should obtain a plot similar
to Figure~\ref{fig:wallis_pi}.
